## 📌 Overview

`multimodal-rag` is a research and experimentation project that aims to develop a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline capable of enhancing plant identification tasks by grounding Gemini’s AI responses with image-based factual references. The core objective is to bridge image recognition with factual knowledge generation in a robust, verifiable way — combining vision and natural language models.

This solution is designed to support applications like BotaniCatch, an educational and assistive mobile app for plant identification.

## 🥅 Goals

- Identify plant species from user-submitted images.
- Use retrieved facts from image-text datasets to ground model responses.
- Build an end-to-end multimodal RAG system using Python and open datasets.
- Train and evaluate on real-world biodiversity data from iNaturalist.

## 🏃 Training & Running

### ⚒️ Setup

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Example Run

```python
from rag_pipeline import run_rag

query = "What is this plant with oval leaves and yellow flowers?"
image_path = "samples/plant_01.jpg"

response = run_rag(image_path, query)
print(response)
```

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Top-k Retrieval Accuracy: Measures if the ground-truth plant appears in the top results.
- Answer Grounding Score: Subjectively rates how factual the Gemini-generated answers are.
- BLEU/ROUGE: For text overlap with reference descriptions.

## 👯 Use Cases

- Educational plant ID assistant.
- Citizen science tools.
- Smart botany guides in mobile applications.
- Herbarium digitization and classification systems.

## ✈️ Future Improvements

- Add multilingual support for plant names.
- Integrate feedback loop for retraining embeddings.
- Explore lightweight local models for offline RAG inference.
